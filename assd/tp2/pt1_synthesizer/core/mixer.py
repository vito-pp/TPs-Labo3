/**
 * @file mix_wav_files.py
 * @brief Mixes multiple .wav files into a single output .wav file.
 *
 * This script prompts the user to enter the number of .wav files to mix,
 * then asks for each file path. It loads all the files, mixes their audio
 * content by summing them, and exports the result as a new .wav file.
 *
 * All files must have the same sample rate, number of channels, and duration.
 * If they differ, the shortest duration will be used as cutoff.
 *
 * @input Paths to multiple .wav files.
 * @output A single mixed .wav file: "mix_output.wav".
